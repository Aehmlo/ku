A [sudoku](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) crate.

# Goals
* First and foremost, to provide a rock-solid API for generating, solving, and manipulating sudokus.
* To become an example of Rust (and general) best practices and become ubiquitous, with support for all kinds of native platforms and the web.

# Contributing
All are welcome to contribute. Please follow the existing code style (which is made much easier if you use the included [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) configuration).
